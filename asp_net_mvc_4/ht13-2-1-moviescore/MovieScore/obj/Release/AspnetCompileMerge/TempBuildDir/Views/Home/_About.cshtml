<p class="lead">
    <strong>moviecheck</strong> gathers data about a given movie title from several movie databases. Giving you in return more fair rating points than what you would get from a single movie database service.
</p>

<p>
    The main goal of the app is to give you a simple, fast and fun way of searching for movie ratings. We have stripped out all the movie trailers, thousands of review articles and user comments, leaving you with what we believe is the
    essential thing about the movie; the plot and its rating score. And when it comes to ratings, you will certainly find them more credible here than anywhere else, as we process data from several movie sources
    and also show you how credible our own rating score is &mdash; all you have to do is pick the movie of your choice.

    <h2 id="how">The scoring system <small>How we do it</small></h2>
</div>
<p>
    The scoring for a given movie, in scale of 1 to 10, is calculated by taking the mean average of rating points from several sources. Although the average might give a fair point, <br />
    we also gather data about <em>how</em> many users from all the sources have voted and with all that gathered data calculate the <em>credibility</em> (what you see as percentile) of the mean score we present you. 
</p>
<p>
    For instance, if a movie you have searched has a scoring of 8/10, there are more than 1 million voters counted and it says that is 70% safe to count on then you have no other options but
    to grab your popcorn and watch the movie, because it is going to be a great one! 
</p>
<p> 
    The same works the other way around &mdash; got a movie which has a scoring of, let's say, 3,2/10 and is about 60% safe to count on? Don't waste your time on that one and find another movie to watch!
