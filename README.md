## Pretty old school!

This repo serves simply as a personal reminder for where I come from as a web developer, containing some of the assignments during my education at Linnaues University in Kalmar, Sweden.

Although some of the code in here might seem as written on a rookie level (well most of it is) it still does make me nostalgic, but also serves as proof of work for programming languages other than Ruby on Rails which I've come to love the most.


## Highlights

Personally, I think the ending project for ASP.net MVC4 (moviecheck) was a milestone in my personal development as it showed me that mashups (digesting data from several APIs) makes it possible to develop web apps that are smart, fun and useful. I've been down that road since then  with some slight differences such as using Ruby on Rails and angular.js but also letting the creativity flow freely with usability and API-first patterns in mind.
